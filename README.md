# ExplainMyLetter

**ExplainMyLetter** is a multilingual assistant that helps people understand official Canadian government letters. It is designed especially for newcomers and residents who may face challenges with language, bureaucracy, or unfamiliar terminology.

This tool uses AI to translate and simplify the content of letters from institutions like IRCC, CRA, RAMQ, SAAQ, and others. It identifies the key message, explains it in clear terms, and outlines any required actions in a step-by-step format.

## Purpose

Many immigrants in Canada receive letters they don’t fully understand — not because they lack the capacity, but because the information is often complex, technical, or not in their preferred language. This app aims to bridge that gap with empathy and accessible technology.

## Who is it for?

- Newcomers and residents in Canada
- People supporting others who receive government letters  

Whether it’s a decision from IRCC, a health insurance notice from RAMQ, a driver’s licence issue from the SAAQ, or a tax letter from the CRA, ExplainMyLetter helps users understand what the letter says and what to do next.

## What it does

- Accepts `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.md` files — including scanned letters or phone photos  
- Extracts text automatically from documents and images  
- Translates and explains letters using AI, in clear and simple language  
- Guides users with clear, numbered action steps when needed  

## Privacy and Security

ExplainMyLetter does not store or share your documents. Files are processed securely and temporarily to extract and interpret their content. 

If the letter is about immigration, you’ll be referred to certified consultants through AskAïa for safe, personalized support.
